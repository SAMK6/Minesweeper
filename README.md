# Modern Minesweeper Clone

## install instructions

Installing my Minesweeper is simple and can be done with a few simple commands. Since this is a QT application you will need QT version 6 or greater and a C++ compiler (if you are on macOS or any debian based linux version you already have the C++ compiler). To Install QT on macOS '''sudo brew install qt6''', and on linux '''sudo apt install qt6-base-dev'''.
